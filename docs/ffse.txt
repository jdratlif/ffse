- Introduction -
----------------

  ffse, the Final Fantasy SRAM Editor is a tool for editing save state files for
  Final Fantasy on the NES.
  
  Instead of taking an emulator dependent save file such as Nesticle states or
  FCEU states, this program works on the emulator independent SRAM files which
  are used by the game internally and will therefore work on any emulator.
  
  These SRAM files are generally named the same as the ROM with a .sav
  extention. For example, "Final Fantasy (U) [!].sav" is one possible example.
  
----------------
- Installation -
----------------

  For Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X I have provided a binary version. You should
  be able to download the binary and run the program by double-clicking the
  executable.
  
  The source code is available if you wish to compile it yourself or are using
  a different platform. You will need a modern C++ compiler and wxWidgets 2.8 or
  later.
  
  On most platforms, you can compile simply by running './configure && make'.
  This should work for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows with mingw/msys. There are
  also Visual Studio project files in the vstudio directory.
  
  For more complete compiling instructions, consult our compiling howto at
  http://games.technoplaza.net/compile.php.

- Usage -
---------

  Using the program should (I hope) be fairly straightforward. Start the program
  ffse either by double-clicking or from the command line.
  
  Load the SRAM .sav file. For FCEU on Windows, this is in the FCEU directory
  in the SAV subdirectory. For FCEU on Unix, this is in the ~/.fceu directory. I
  don't know about other emulators because I don't use them. The program should
  work on any emulator that uses the battery backed RAM (SRAM), which nearly
  all modern ones do.
  
  Once the file is open, it will load the game. If the SRAM file is not valid,
  or doesn't have a save game, the program will inform you and not load
  anything.
  
  There are three tabs, "General", "Character", and "Magic". They will allow
  you to edit almost any part of the game. Items you have, your characters
  stats, magic you have learned, etc.
  
  Some things I have yet to implement (because I don't know where they are
  stored in the SRAM) include the location of the ship and the airship, and
  whether or not you have them. If there is something you want to be
  able to edit that you cannot, contact me and I'll see what I can do.
  
  When you load a .SAV file, it will make a backup in a file named the same as
  your SRAM file with a .bak on the end. If something goes wrong when you try
  to start your edited game, just delete the SRAM file and rename the backup to
  .sav instead of .sav.bak. Note that if you load the SRAM file, make changes,
  and load it again, you will lose the original backup. Personally, it wouldn't
  hurt to make a backup copy of your SRAM file before editing it if your
  original is important to you. Though I have complete faith in the program,
  better safe than sorry.

- Notes -
---------

  Some important things to be aware of.
  
  - This is BETA software. Your use of it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. I take no
    responsibility if this program screws up your data, or any other
    thing on your or any other computer. I'm pretty sure it won't, but don't
    blame me if it does!
    
  - The program checks for valid values in most cases, but I'm not altogether
    sure all the ranges I put in are correct. Contact me if you feel a valid
    value is being ignored by the program.
    
  - You can create some invalid combinations. Equipping two weapons or armors
    for example. This seems to have the positive effect of adding both weapons
    and armors stats to your attack/defense stats, but I have not tested it
    enough to be sure it isn't harmful to the game. The program will warn you
    if you have equipped duplicate equipment, but will allow you to save if you
    say OK.

    - His save state hacking guide for Nesticle was invaluable in creating this
      program. I would have had to do all the research myself otherwise.
